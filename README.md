# Simple Time Tracker

## üÜï What I‚Äôm Working On

I started this project because I was frustrated with time trackers like Toggl ‚Äî too many clicks, too many features, and far more complexity than I need. I wanted something **simple, fast, and frictionless**, built with Laravel and Hotwire.

**Key ideas:**  
- Track time with **minimal friction**  
- **Timers remember** your last client/project  
- **Keyboard shortcuts** to start/stop quickly  
- MIT-licensed, open-source, focused on doing **one thing really well**

You **can try it now**, but things are still rough. Waiting until next week gives you a **more polished interface** ready for everyday use. Feedback is very welcome ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to see how it fits your workflow.

> **Status ‚Äî Early development.** This project is under active development. APIs, database schema, and UX may change and breaking changes are expected. Do not run this in production systems.

A minimal time-tracking app built with Laravel 12 and Hotwire. Track time across clients and projects ‚Äî no bloat, just tracking.

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# User Management
php artisan app:create-user                    # Create your user account
php artisan user:reset-password user@email.com # Reset user password

## üë§ User Management

This application is designed for **single-user use**. Registration is automatically disabled after the first user is created, making it perfect for personal time tracking.

### Creating Your User Account

After installation, create your user account:

```bash
php artisan app:create-user
```

This interactive command will prompt you for:
- **Name**: Your display name
- **Email**: Your login email address
- **Password**: Secure password (minimum 8 characters)
- **Hourly Rate**: Your default hourly rate (optional)

### Resetting User Password

If you forget your password or need to reset it, you can use the command line:

#### Interactive Password Reset
```bash
php artisan user:reset-password your-email@example.com
```

This command will:
1. Verify the user exists
2. Prompt you to enter a new password (securely hidden)
3. Ask you to confirm the password
4. Validate the password meets requirements (minimum 8 characters)
5. Update the user's password

#### Non-Interactive Password Reset
For automated scripts or when you want to provide the password directly:

```bash
php artisan user:reset-password your-email@example.com --password="your-new-password"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: When using the `--password` option, the password may be visible in your shell history. Use the interactive method for better security.

#### Examples
```bash
# Interactive (recommended)
php artisan user:reset-password john@example.com

# Direct password (less secure)
php artisan user:reset-password john@example.com --password="MyNewSecurePassword123"

# If user email has spaces or special characters, use quotes
php artisan user:reset-password "user with spaces@example.com"
```

#### Troubleshooting
- **"User not found"**: Double-check the email address is correct
- **"Password validation failed"**: Ensure password is at least 8 characters
- **"Passwords do not match"**: Make sure you type the same password twice in interactive mode

### Single User Restriction

- Only **one user** is allowed per installation
- **Registration routes are automatically disabled** once a user exists
- The login form **hides the "Create Account" link** when a user exists
- Perfect for **personal use** or **single-person businesses**

### Force Create Additional User

If you need to create another user for testing (not recommended for production):

```bash
php artisan app:create-user --force
```

| **EU** + 24-hour | `25.12.2025` | `25.12.2025 14:30` |

All dates and times in reports, time entries, and dashboards will automatically update to match your preferences.

> üí° **Tip**: You can mix and match date and time formats independently. For example, use EU date format (25.12.2025) with 12-hour time (2:30 PM) if that's your preference!

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views/               # Standard Blade views
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Hotwire-First**: Minimal JavaScript, server-rendered HTML.  
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable Blade components.  
- **Single Responsibility**: Focused controllers and models.  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works even without JavaScript.

### Date/Time Format Implementation
The date and time formatting system uses:
- **Enums**: `App\Enums\DateFormat` and `App\Enums\TimeFormat` for type safety
- **Blade Components**: `<x-user-date>`, `<x-user-time>`, `<x-user-datetime>` for consistent display
- **User Preferences**: Stored in database and accessed via `User->getPreferredDateFormat()` / `User->getPreferredTimeFormat()`
- **Automatic Updates**: All views automatically respect user preferences without manual formatting

### Common Issues

**Forgot Password?**  
Use the command line to reset: `php artisan user:reset-password your-email@example.com`

**Can't Login?**  
Check if your user exists: `php artisan tinker` then `App\Models\User::all()`

**Application Errors?**  
Clear caches: `php artisan optimize:clear` then `php artisan optimize`

Currently, I am looking for someone to help **revamp the UI** to make it truly simple and minimalistic. Contributions and suggestions for design improvements are very welcome.
